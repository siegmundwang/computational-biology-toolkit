Go to the database UniProt www.uniprot.org; let us know the number of human proteins (UniProtKB), as well as the amount of well-annotated human proteins (SwissProt) in the newest release.
检索UniProt可得, 未注释的人类的蛋白质个数为142774; 人工注释和审核的蛋白质个数为20341; 可认为人类的总蛋白数为142774+20341=163115
Try to analyze the proteomics data human proteomics samples (5 cancer and 5
normal) using MaxQuant software Describe the number of peptides and protein you identified (FDR<0.01).
3. The expressions of mini-peptides have been reported in human proteome studies. In
order to investigate the expression of possible mini-peptides in human proteome,
please perform the following steps:
(1) Use 3-frame translation to predict the ORF in human ref genome, of which length
is between 6 and 100 AA [6,100].
(2) Remove the entries contained by any known human proteins, as well as the
redundancy.
(3) Construct a fasta database using the putative mini-peptides, and detect their
expression in ten human proteomics samples mentioned in #2.
(4) Summarize your database and report the mini-peptides you find (FDR<=0.01).
You may find the proteomics data at /share/data/proteomics/colorectal_cancer, the reference
genome at /share/data/proteomics/. Please contact TA if you have any question about data
download or software running.
* Discussion is encouraged. BUT, please finish your homework independently
